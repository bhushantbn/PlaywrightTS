@lambdatesting is fantastic. Cross browser and device testingtesting frustration is minimized. You canâ€™t get rid of clients that need ie11 nor can you own every device but lambda test bridge that gap.Mat Gargano@matgargano,https://twitter.com/matgargano/status/1332857624329654273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1332857624329654273%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lambdatest.com%2Freviews
