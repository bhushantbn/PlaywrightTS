## Introduction

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static typing to the language, which can help catch errors early during development and improve code maintainability.

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is a powerful open-source automation tool for web testing and browser automation. It allows you to automate interactions with web pages across multiple browsers, including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

This guide will walk you through the basics of using TypeScript with Playwright to write automated browser tests.
